Version 0.0.2
First stage
Todo:
  General:
    ✔ Research noise functions @high , @done(17-11-09 23:37)
    ✔ Research how to improve noise @done(17-11-11 21:58)
      (Need continents and oceans, also river and lake generation would be nice)
    ☐ Research river and biome generation @high 
    ☐ Look into Doxygen for automatic documentation @low 
  Coding:
    ☐ Implement pre-visualization of world generation @low 
    ☐ Create more cube types @high 
    ☐ Create world generation @critical 
      (merge noise generation with chunks)
    ☐ Implement Physics @low 
    ☐ Implement Menu and GUI @low 
  Debuging:
  Documentation:
    ☐ Improve documentation and comments @medium,  
    ☐ If Doxygen is suitable, modify documentation to fit Doxygen @low 
  Refactoring:
    ☐ Cube faces are currently using 4 normals, revise decision @low 
      (If smoothing or similar techniques are used, this is justified, else change to 1)
    ✔ Attempt to make cube fetching chunk agnostic @low @done(17-11-11 23:34)
      (Ideally chunks and cubes should be fetched without information of the world array)
    ☐ Embrace C++ and make all relevant functions into class member functions @high 
      (Instead of stand alone functions, OOP is good, why not fully embrace it?)
    ☐ Minimize overhead to the maximum @medium, 
      (Revise current version and edit all structures and functions to minimize overhead)
