Version 0.0.3
Third stage
Todo:
  General:
    ☐ Revise all TODOS @low 
    ☐ Add shadows through shadow mapping @high 
    ☐ Improve world generation @medium 
      (Need continents and oceans, also river and lake generation would be nice)
    ☐ Research river and biome generation @high 
  Coding:
    ☐ Create more shaders and create the code to select them appropriately
    ☐ Modify shaders to have multiple textures and potentially mesh information @medium 
    ☐ Smooth cube edges to create less blocky feeling @medium  
    ☐ Implement pre-visualization of world generation @low 
    ☐ Create more cube types @high 
    ☐ Implement Physics @low 
    ☐ Implement Menu and GUI @low 
  Debuging:
    ☐ Figure out why there are parts of the world loading when moving world box @medium 
    ☐ Fix problem with world generation involving negative x,y coordinates @medium 
      (Currently fixed through absolute value, but this creates mirroring)
  Documentation:
    ☐ Improve documentation and comments @medium  
  Refactoring:
    ☐ Reduce matrix passing into shaders so as to pass only one model matrix @medium 
    ✘ Evaluate and fix race condition @low @cancelled(18-02-12 01:07)
      (There is technically a race condition between the world thread and the render 
      thread, what was it? is it still there?)
