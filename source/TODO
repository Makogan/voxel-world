Version 0.0.2
First stage
Todo:
  General:
    ✔ Research noise functions @high , @done(17-11-09 23:37)
    ✔ Research how to improve noise @done(17-11-11 21:58)
      (Need continents and oceans, also river and lake generation would be nice)
    ☐ Research river and biome generation @high 
    ☐ Look into Doxygen for automatic documentation @low 
  Coding:
    ☐ Smooth cube edges to create less blocky feeling @medium 
    ✔ Optimize chunk update @medium @done(18-01-13 19:34)
      (Marked for revision, it's impossible to reduce asymptotic time, maybe not needed) 
    ✔ Code world loading @critical @done(17-11-19 15:02)
    ✔ Multithread @medium, @done(18-01-13 19:34)
      (1 thread for the player, 1 for rendering, 1 for world events, 1 for entitites)
    ☐ Implement pre-visualization of world generation @low 
    ☐ Create more cube types @high 
    ✔ Create world generation @critical @done(17-11-14 22:17)
      (merge noise generation with chunks)
      ☐ Improve world generation @medium 
    ☐ Implement Physics @low 
    ☐ Implement Menu and GUI @low 
  Debuging:
    ✔ Gaps are created over time when moving around @critical @done(17-11-19 15:02)
    ☐ Fix problem with world generation involving negative x,y coordinates @medium 
      (Currently fixed through absolute value, but this creates mirroring)
    ✔ Shifitng the world by more than 1 creates gaps @medium @done(17-11-15 22:58)
  Documentation:
    ☐ Add missing documentation @medium 
    ☐ Improve documentation and comments @medium  
    ☐ If Doxygen is suitable, modify documentation to fit Doxygen @low 
  Refactoring:
    ✔ Wrap all OpenGL operations and make structs into classes @done(18-02-11 19:51)
    ☐ Evaluate and fix race condition @low 
      (There is technically a race condition between the world thread and the render 
      thread, what was it? is it still there?)
    ✔ Move all general headers to a single header @medium @done(18-01-13 21:37)
    ✔ Move Perlin noise and similar functions to library @medium @done(18-02-11 19:53)
    ✔ Delete the black face code @high @done(18-02-11 19:49)
    ✔ Fix all modulus arithmetic @done(17-11-15 23:00)
      (you can reduce ((x+i)%n+n)%n to simply (x+i+n)%n)
    ✔ Try to move all rendering info (VBO's, SSBO's) to the rendering handler @low @done(18-02-11 19:49)
      (or at least as much as possible, this should make multithreading easier)
    ✔ Cube faces are currently using 4 normals, revise decision @low @done(18-02-11 19:49)
      (If smoothing or similar techniques are used, this is justified, else change to 1)
    ✔ Attempt to make cube fetching chunk agnostic @low @done(17-11-11 23:34)
      (Ideally chunks and cubes should be fetched without information of the world array)
    ✔ Embrace C++ and make all relevant functions into class member functions @high @done(18-02-11 19:49)
      (Instead of stand alone functions, OOP is good, why not fully embrace it?)
    ✔ Minimize overhead to the maximum @medium @done(18-01-13 19:45)
      (Revise current version and edit all structures and functions to minimize overhead)
