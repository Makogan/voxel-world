Version 0.0.1
First stage
Todo:
  General:
    ✔ Create Basic template Code and Data structures
    ✘ Design basic physics (moved to future version)
    ✔ Design basic world Data Structures
    ✘ Create Menu rendering (or use library, experiment) (moved to future version)
    ✘ Document (look into automatic documentation) (moved to future version)
  Coding:
    ✔ Make a shading program that renders multiple meshes at a time (Jeremy Hart knows how 
    to do this, check with him)
    ✔ Once there is a voxel world, test and modify rendering for optimization
  Debuging:
    ✔ Figure out how blender maps the texture coordinates and get it to work (cube looks 
    odd)
  Documentation:
    ✔ Refactor and comment everything
    ✘ Look into Doxygen (moved to future version)
    ✘ If Doxygen is suitable, change comments to fit Doxygen (moved to future version)
  Refactoring:
    ✘ Change loadCamera() and loadViewProjMatrix() headers to be consistend with the 
    "Load" API (cancelled)
    ✔ Optimize "Mega Chunks" and chunk rendering 
    ✔ Add missing comments and revise all "TODO's"
